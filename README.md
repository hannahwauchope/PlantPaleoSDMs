# PlantPaleoSDMs
 These are scripts used in an analysis to create SDMs (using BioMod2) on present day occurrences of plant species (occurrences from GBIF, climate data from CRU), and to project those distributions back in time (onto downscaled climate data from paleoview). These projectsions are then compared to fossil pollen occurrences from Neotoma.
